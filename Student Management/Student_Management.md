# Student Management System

This is a simple student management system implemented in C++. It allows users to perform various operations related to student data management such as adding new students, retrieving student details, updating student information, and deleting student records.

## Features

- **Add New Student Data:** Enter details such as name, father's name, mother's name, mobile number, address, course, admission date, and date of birth for a new student.
  
- **Get Student Details:**
  - Search and display student details by student name or student key.
  - Option to generate a receipt for a student's details.

- **Delete Student Data:**
  - Delete individual student records by student key.
  - Option to delete all student records.

- **Update Student Data:**
  - Update student information including course, name, father's name, mother's name, mobile number, address, and date of birth.

## How to Use

1. **Compilation:**
   - Compile the program using a C++ compiler that supports C++11 standard or later. For example:
     ```
     g++ -std=c++11 main.cpp -o student_management_system
     ```
   
2. **Execution:**
   - Run the compiled executable:
     ```
     ./student_management_system
     ```
   
3. **Menu Navigation:**
   - Use numeric commands to navigate through the menu:
     - Enter '1' to add new student data.
     - Enter '2' to retrieve student details.
     - Enter '3' to delete all student data.
     - Enter '4' to delete specific student data.
     - Enter '5' to update student data.
   
4. **Data Input and Display:**
   - Follow on-screen instructions to input and display student data.
   - Use appropriate inputs to navigate through various operations (e.g., entering student names, keys for detailed student information).

5. **Exiting the Program:**
   - Use the appropriate exit command (e.g., typically 'Ctrl + C' or as specified by the console environment).

## Additional Notes

- **File Output:** The program can generate a text file containing a receipt of student details upon request.
- **Data Persistence:** Data is stored in memory during program execution. Ensure appropriate backup or storage mechanisms for long-term data persistence.
